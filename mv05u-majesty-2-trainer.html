                            <p> Here's a follow-up to my post asking for a list of all of the ETBs. I made a list! Plasma Storm Elite Trainer Box Plasma Blast Elite Trainer Box XY Xerneas Elite Trainer Box XY Yveltal Elite Trainer Box Furious Fists Elite Trainer Box Phantom Forces Elite Trainer Box Primal Clash Primal Groudon Elite Trainer Box Primal Clash Primal Kyogre Elite Trainer Box Roaring Skies Elite Trainer Box Ancient Origins Elite Trainer Box BREAKthrough Elite Trainer Box Mewtwo X BREAKthrough Elite. I'm not the most avid or knowledgeable TCG collector, so just wondering if a Dragon Majesty Elite Trainer Box or even a bunch of loose packs off Ebay/Amazon is worth it? amp#x200B; I've noticed that there is a crazy expensive card in the set (Ultra Necrozma GX Gold), so at a glance, it appears to be a set worth investing in. However, I'm not too savvy when it comes to price increases/decreases on cards. Is it only worth a lot now because it's a good card to use? Will this change? amp#x20. bvirtual ~~Just looking for 2 Lele codes, pls. Reasonably priced.~~ And I have too many PTCGO codes, get them away from me. Boxes are 1 code, unless specified. 1 Plasma Blast 3 XY Base 4 Flashfire 7 Furious Fists 3 Phantom Forces 7 Primal Clash 12 Roaring Skies 9 Ancient Origins 20 Breakthrough 2 BREAKpoint 13 Fates Collide 14 Steam Seige 35 Evolutions 12 Sun amp Moon 15 Guardians Rising 15 Burning Shadows 9 Crimson Invasion. I got a dragon majesty elite trainer box and I want to make a dragon deck. I got some good pulls and I want to make a good deck. I got a dragonite GX and I want to make a deck surrounding it. I got 2 zinnia, 2 Dragon talon(One gold :P), few dratini, a few dragonair, a some other stuff like trapinch,vibrava and flygon. From dragon majesty, what are some good dragon decks?? If needed I can buy some cards. 
I just opened a Dragon Majesty Elite Trainer box. Two packs had duplicates or Garados rare (4 total in two packs). I also got nothing ultra rare like GXs and stuff. Has this happened to anyone. There is a sale on the presale of a Dragon Majesty ETB on Ebay right now. For those that don't know the retail price is going to be 49.99. https://www.ebay.com/itm/Pokemon-Dragon-Majesty-Elite-Trainer-Booster-Box-Set-10-packs-more/253785827392?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AITamp_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649. Time for 2 pieces of news! ##### TLDR: Dragon Majesty ETB will release on September 21st for .99 The Naganadel-GX promo is a reprint of Naganadel-GX from Forbidden Light, but with alternate art. It will likely be part of Japan’s GX Ultra Shiny set. As posted many months ago, the Dragon Majesty Elite Trainer Box is like the Shining Legends ETB: it comes with ten booster packs instead of the usual eight as well as a promo card. The rest of the contents are what’s normally includ.

Bloodlines is, IMO, one of the most important criteria to consider in every race. It can give you clues on which horse(s) will perform the best in sprints, middle distances, long distances, dirt, grass, all weather tracks. But using bloodlines alone will leave most to frustrating results, much like anything else you can think of using, including speed ratings, trainers stats, jockey stats, expert picks and everything else. However, when you take bloodlines, then try to figure out when a trainer. Hello, after a year-long work trip I am back to sell/trade again. Everything is for sale or trade but I would prefer to trade, binders are starting to get full. vv Trade Binders are below Wants List vv ###Pricing (PLEASE READ) As far as prices go, I will be using TCGPlayer pricing to compare and give a discount off of that depending on what you are interested in and how much you would like to purchase. To save time, you can look these cards up yourself (lowest available NM/M). My educated guess for the rotation is at the very bottom. With us being in Q4, some of us are looking forward to working towards their worlds invite while the others (like me) are instead looking forward to next season. From both a financial and competitive standpoint, rotation in the standard format is an incredibly vital factor. As such, today Iwill make an educated guess on which sets will rotate out using history, deduction as well as logical assumptions. To begin, rotation Not much, I'll start by saying! amp#x200B; I previously made a post called What To Expect At Assessment Centre (https://www.reddit.com/r/britishmilitary/comments/aloks4/assessment_centre_what_to_expect/) and promised I'd keep making posts about my experiences as I move through the process of becoming a reserve soldier. Thought I'd keep the ball rolling and make a post on what the fuck attestation actually is, and does it actually fucking matter? And maybe a bit on what to expect I have tried googling but having issues actually finding a list. Is there a list of all Elite Trainer boxes and the premium ones? Is Shining legends, dragon majesty, and the generations the only premium boxes? Thanks. 
Hello everyone! I stopped following the Pokémon TCG after Crimson Invasion got released. I sort of have the urge to get back in it as a casual (I was always a casual). I’m looking into buying the Team Up booster packs, maybe the tins with the Venusaur amp Celebi Promo or should I go the Elite Trainer Box route? I am also curious about the Dragon Majesty expansion. How can I get my hands on it. Are there tins or Elite Trainer Boxes for it. How are the pull rates of getting Hello everyone! I am looking for certain Pokemon that are exclusive to events, and I have some event Pokemon that I would like to trade! By the way, some of these Pokemon have been used by me, so they may not be in the original condition of the event. The Pokemon will not have their original items from the event. These are the Pokemon that I have to trade: amp#x200B; Event Moves Level OT/Trainer ID Nature Ribbons Obtainment Method Touched? :- :- :- :- :- :- :- :- Shiny Originally posted 03/30/2019 \ updated 04/03/19 @10pm\ amp#x200B; I am willing to provide PayPal on my side to help trades go through, or even to purchase my wants straight up. Just let me know what you have! =) amp#x200B; Updates: \ \ \ SR Judge Whistle x2 sold. FA Sceptile GX and FA Hoopa EX have been sold. Gengar Mimikyu TTGX AFA, Dawn Wings GX FA, Ultra Necrozma FA, and a few of the Reverse Holo rares (message for what remains) have been traded. Volcanion Prism Star is pendi. Me and my wife have got an itch to start collecting again and possibly builing a deck for local tournements (just for fun). My thoughts are to stat with an elite trainer box, and I am debating between the Burning Shadows, Team Up, Dragons Majesty, and Shining Legends. I know Unbroken Bonds is coming out early May, but wouldn't mind starting sooner than that. Which set is best to start with the intentions of possibly playing against people. Collected in Shape Shifter (Telegram, 2011): # Tuxedo gt EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT TUXEDO HAS GOOD ideas about as often as a hen has teeth. Which is why Tuxedo is on his own this particular night, crouching with his ear to the tumbrils of a small safe behind the counter of the video shop. The snag is that Tuxedo is not built for crouching lower than a pool table. His left foot has cramp and his blue satin boxer shorts are twisted in his crotch causing him aggravation. On top of all this, twiddlin. amp#x200B; Previous update (https://www.reddit.com/r/EvenAsIWrite/comments/am6ksz/deathbringer_part_15/) Index (https://www.reddit.com/r/EvenAsIWrite/comments/abt12w/deathbringer_index/) :- :- Roedran picked his ears nonchalantly as he sat on his throne, overlooking the room. It had been one of his first requests, to ensure his throne was elevated enough that he could see everyone in the room without having to stand. He was the only person sitting on the raised platform with his atten. 
This is a tier list for the current VGC 2019 Moon Series metagame, aka how good is everything compared to a cat. There are two different lists, one for Non-Restricted Pokemon and one for the Restricted Pokemon because they function very differently in teambuilding. Tier lists in Pokemon have their limitations, mainly because Pokemon can come and go out of nowhere and the fact many Pokemon can be trash in theory but amazing in practice, especially on different teams. For example, Tornadus-Inc. UPDATE 2: Thanks for all the drawing submissions! I've announced the winners below, and I'll inbox you your codes shortly. There are still a few up for grabs, I'll give them to the first person to post their doodle of that pokemon.  UPDATE: Out of regular codes, but still have the ones for the drawing contest up for grabs (see below)! Thanks for the great responses!  I've been collecting pokemon cards for ~3 years, and I never got into the online game. So I have about 170 unused codes. </p>
